A custom resource:

- Is a simple extension of Chef Infra Client that adds your own resources
- Is implemented and shipped as part of a cookbook
- Leverages resources that are built into Chef Infra Client and/or custom Ruby code
- Is reusable in the same way as resources that are built into Chef Infra Client

For example, Chef Infra Client includes built-in resources to manage
files, packages, templates, and services, but it does not include a
resource that manages websites.

## Syntax

A custom resource is defined as a Ruby file and is located in a
cookbook's `/resources` directory. This file:

- Declares the properties of the custom resource
- Defines actions the custom resource may take

The layout for a custom resource is:

```ruby
property :property_name, RubyType, default: 'value'

action :action_a do
 # a mix of built-in Chef resources and Ruby
end

action :action_b do
 # a mix of built-in Chef resources and Ruby
end
```

The first action listed is the default action.

### Example Resource

This example `site` utilizes Chef's built-in `file`, `service` and
`package` resources, and includes `:create` and `:delete` actions. Since
it uses built-in Chef Infra Client resources, besides defining the
property and actions, the code is very similar to that of a recipe.

```ruby
property :homepage, String, default: '<h1>Hello world!</h1>'

action :create do
  package 'httpd'

  service 'httpd' do
    action [:enable, :start]
  end

  file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
    content new_resource.homepage
  end
end

action :delete do
  package 'httpd' do
    action :remove
  end

  file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
    action :delete
  end
end
```

where

- `homepage` is a property that sets the default HTML for the
  `index.html` file with a default value of `'<h1>Hello world!</h1>'`
- the `action` block uses the built-in collection of resources to tell
  Chef Infra Client how to install Apache, start the service, and then
  create the contents of the file located at
  `/var/www/html/index.html`
- `action :create` is the default resource, because it is listed
  first; `action :delete` must be called specifically (because it is
  not the default action)

Once written, the custom resource may be used in a recipe just like any
of the resources that are built into Chef Infra Client. The resource
gets its name from the cookbook and from the file name in the
`/resources` directory, with an underscore (`_`) separating them. For
example, a cookbook named `exampleco` with a custom resource named
`site.rb` is used in a recipe like this:

```ruby
exampleco_site 'httpd' do
  homepage '<h1>Welcome to the Example Co. website!</h1>'
end
```

and to delete the exampleco website, do the following:

```ruby
exampleco_site 'httpd' do
  action :delete
end
```

## Scenario: website Resource

Create a resource that configures Apache httpd for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7 and CentOS 7.

This scenario covers the following:

1. Defining a cookbook named `website`
2. Defining two properties
3. Defining an action
4. For the action, defining the steps to configure the system using resources that are built into Chef Infra
5. Creating two templates that support the custom resource
6. Adding the resource to a recipe

### Create a Cookbook

This article assumes that a cookbook directory named `website` exists in
a chef-repo with (at least) the following directories:

```text
/website
  /recipes
  /resources
  /templates
```

You may use a cookbook that already exists or you may create a new
cookbook.

See /ctl_chef.html for more information about how to use the `chef`
command-line tool that is packaged with Chef Workstation to build the
chef-repo, plus related cookbook sub-directories.

### Objectives

Define a custom resource!

A custom resource typically contains:

- A list of defined custom properties (property values are specified
  in recipes)
- At least one action (actions tell Chef Infra Client what to do)
- For each action, use a collection of resources that are built into
  Chef Infra Client to define the steps required to complete the
  action

#### What is needed?

This custom resource requires:

- Two template files
- Two properties
- An action that defines all of the steps necessary to create the
  website

### Define Properties

Custom properties are defined in the resource. This custom resource
needs two:

- `instance_name`
- `port`

These properties are defined as variables in the `httpd.conf.erb` file.
A **template** block in recipes will tell Chef Infra Client how to apply
these variables.

In the custom resource, add the following custom properties:

```ruby
property :instance_name, String, name_property: true
property :port, Integer, required: true
```

where

- `String` and `Integer` are Ruby types (all custom properties must
  have an assigned Ruby type)
- `name_property: true` allows the value for this property to be equal
  to the `'name'` of the resource block

The `instance_name` property is then used within the custom resource in
many locations, including defining paths to configuration files,
services, and virtual hosts.

### Define Actions

Each custom resource must have at least one action that is defined
within an `action` block:

```ruby
action :create do
  # the steps that define the action
end
```

where `:create` is a value that may be assigned to the `action` property
for when this resource is used in a recipe.

For example, the `action` appears as a property when this custom
resource is used in a recipe:

```ruby
custom_resource 'name' do
  # some properties
  action :create
end
```

### Define Resource

Use the **package**, **template** (two times), **directory**, and
**service** resources to define the `website` resource. Remember: order
matters!

#### package

Use the **package** resource to install httpd:

```ruby
package 'httpd' # Ommiting the action uses the default action and properties on the resource
```

#### template, httpd.conf

Use the **template** resource to configure httpd on the node based on
the `httpd.conf.erb` template located in the cookbook:

```ruby
template "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd-#{new_resource.instance_name}.conf" do
  source 'httpd.conf.erb'
  variables(
    instance_name: new_resource.instance_name,
    port: new_resource.port
  )
  action :create
end
```

where

- `source` gets the `httpd.conf.erb` template from this cookbook
- `variables` assigns the `instance_name` and `port` properties to
    variables in the template

{{< note >}}

When writing a shared custom resource, you may need to use templates
that ship with the custom resource. However, you will need to specify
the cookbook containing the template by using the cookbook property in
the template resource. If this is not set, then Chef Infra Client will
look for templates in the location of the cookbook that is using the
resource and won't be able to find them. Example: `cookbook 'website'`

{{< /note >}}

#### directory

Use the **directory** resource to create the `/var/www/vhosts` directory
on the node:

```ruby
directory "/var/www/vhosts/#{new_resource.instance_name}" do
  recursive true
  action :create
end
```

#### service

Use the **service** resource to enable, and then start the service:

```ruby
service "httpd-#{new_resource.instance_name}" do
  action [:enable, :start]
end
```

### Final Resource

```ruby
property :instance_name, String, name_property: true
property :port, Integer, required: true

action :create do
  package 'httpd' do
    action :install
  end

  template "/lib/systemd/system/httpd-#{new_resource.instance_name}.service" do
    source 'httpd.service.erb'
    variables(
      instance_name: new_resource.instance_name
    )
    action :create
  end

  template "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd-#{new_resource.instance_name}.conf" do
    source 'httpd.conf.erb'
    variables(
      instance_name: new_resource.instance_name,
      port: new_resource.port
    )
    action :create
  end

  directory "/var/www/vhosts/#{new_resource.instance_name}" do
    recursive true
    action :create
  end

  service "httpd-#{new_resource.instance_name}" do
    action [:enable, :start]
  end

end
```

### Final Cookbook Directory

When finished adding the templates and building the custom resource, the
cookbook directory structure should look like this:

```text
/website
  metadata.rb
  /recipes
    default.rb
  README.md
  /resources
    httpd.rb
  /templates
    httpd.conf.erb
    httpd.service.erb
```

### Recipe

The custom resource name is inferred from the name of the cookbook
(`website`), the name of the resource file (`httpd`), and is separated
by an underscore(`_`): `website_httpd`. The custom resource may be used
in a recipe.

```ruby
website_httpd 'httpd_site' do
  port 81
  action :create
end
```

which does the following:

- Installs Apache httpd
- Assigns an instance name of `httpd_site` that uses port 81
- Configures httpd and systemd from a template
- Creates the virtual host for the website
- Starts the website using systemd

## Custom Resource DSL

The following sections describe additional Custom Resource DSL methods
that were not used in the preceding scenario:

### action_class

Use the `action_class` block to make methods available to the actions in
the custom resource. Modules with helper methods created as files in the
cookbook library directory may be included. New action methods may also
be defined directly in the `action_class` block. Code in the
`action_class` block has access to the new_resource properties.

Assume a helper module has been created in the cookbook
`libraries/helper.rb` file.

```ruby
module Sample
  module Helper
    def helper_method
      # code
    end
  end
end
```

Methods may be made available to the custom resource actions by using an
`action_class` block.

```ruby
property file, String

action :delete do
  helper_method
  FileUtils.rm(new_resource.file) if file_exist
end

action_class do

  def file_exist
    ::File.exist?(new_resource.file)
  end

  require 'fileutils'

  include Sample::Helper

end
```
